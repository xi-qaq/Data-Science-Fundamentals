A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair.
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time.
You flip the coin another 5 times, same result.
How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin?
Explain your reasoning a bit.


My answer: 10 times.
If the coin is fair, the probability of getting 10 heads in a row is (0.5)^10 = 0.0009765625,
which is smaller than 0.1%. I think this is enough to reach my threshold of doubt.
